This module came about when I was thinking of a way to add system messages to a page, I thought of writing some css and adding it in a div, but that was not resuable. i created a module (my very 1st) to take a user made place it in a div and set a css style around it.

Three styles are currently supported:

  * error
  * alert
  * message
