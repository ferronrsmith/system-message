#summary A Joomla module that allows administrators to add system messages anywhere.

= Introduction =

Joomla system-message creator is a module that came about when I was thinking of a way to add system messages to a page. I thought of writing css and adding it in a div, but that was not reusable. i created a module (my very 1st) to take a *user message* and *message_type* place it in a div and set a css style.


Install the module and your done. For further information on using this module, please see link below:
